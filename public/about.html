<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Elke Mathis. Currently, I am a special education teaching assistant. I am passionate about working
   with children with special needs and helping to create a safe and supportive learning environment. I strive to provide 
   each student with the resources and support they need to reach their potential. I look forward to continuing this 
   important work.</p>

<p>Recently, I've decided to pivot and learn how to become a Web Developer. I'm excited to use my existing knowledge and 
  skills to build and create websites and applications that can benefit everyone. I'm looking forward to the challenge and 
  to learning new skills that can help to make the world a more inclusive place. I'm also excited to collaborate with other 
  developers to create innovative solutions to pressing global issues.</p>

<p>I believe that with the right combination of skills, dedication and hard work, I can make a difference. I'm looking forward
   to the opportunity to use my skills to build something meaningful and impactful. I'm confident that with the collective effort 
   of developers around the world, we can create a better future.</p>
